# 1. Nuxt.js as a easy foundation of PWA

- Explain what Nuxt.js (preferably few words about Next.js too, since we have a lot of React fans in comunity) is and why it's a good starting point. Will be nice to say something about Vue CLI v3, since it's may be a great alternive for many people.
- Setup Nuxt.js from scratch
- Explain the role of nuxt.config.js
- Add Alpaca components (like it's the part of project, but already prepared)
- Explain pages and create new one using Alpaca components (use static data from `/data`)
- Explain how routing works and implement basic dynamic routing for the default page (id in url, that will be used in next parts of workshops)
- Explain plugins and add some (for sure PWA, but maybe smth else too)
- Show Lighthouse scores
- Explain the role of layouts
